          <div class="card">
            <span>Why do you keep 30% from all earning?</span>

            <p>
              We do not take any commission from public performing royalties nor
              collect them in Sri Lanka. 100% (less any admin fee by the
              collector) public performing royalties should be paid to you by
              the relevant CMO that collect it for you in Sri Lanka We have
              provided over 150 authors and composers a free membership to
              register them worldwide, to register you and your songs to make
              them eligible to earn required specialist acknowledged as well as
              international operations that require adequate staffing, resources
              and funding. Only way we can make our investment back is by
              keeping a commission from the earning we made possible for you.
              Company also will recreate your songs to make further earning
              potentials and keep them popular in the public. We also have tax
              obligations and other commitments such as licensing, monitoring
              and maintain our services and products which all require funds to
              operate correctly to earn on your rights.

          <div class="card">
            <span> Why does my song say it’s ‘pending’?</span>
            <p>
              This usually means we’re in the process of getting the song
              registered at the PROs/CMOs. Once you’ve added a new song to the
              website, we need to send this information off to the different
              collection societies in order to set up registrations.

          <div class="card">
            <span> I’ve not been paid for my radio/tv play. </span>

            <p>
              Radio and television royalties (Please do not get confused with
              licence and royalty pay) should come through automatically about
              9-12 months after the date of the broadcast and, because of this,
              we are unable to proactively make claims for broadcasts like we
              can for other platforms. However, we can follow up with the CMO if
              you haven’t been paid for specific broadcasts after 12 months –
              that’s why it’s a good idea to keep your We Did It Global account
              up to date with any broadcasts you’re aware of.

          <div class="card">
            <span> How can I claim royalties from YouTube? </span>

            <p>
              If your music is receiving substantial views on YouTube or if you
              know it is being used without your permission on the platform then
              please email info@wediditglobal.com to ensure it has been
              delivered to YouTube’s Content ID platform, ensure it is protected
              and where possible royalties are being generated. What the
              difference between Royalty Pay and Licencing Pay Royalty pay is
              that generate after a song been broadcasted whereas Licencing Pay
              required to be paid before using the songs been broadcasted known
              as “Blanket Licensing” or before attempting to remake/reproduced
              such as in reality TV programs

          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <span> Why haven’t I been paid for the use in public yet? </span>

            <p>
              In Sri Lanka there is no proper mechanism to collect royalties
              from public performing yet. Crucially lack of active Collective
              Management Organisation for authors and composers as well as for
              the publishers such as We Did It Global. Once a CMO established
              and operational as a rough guide, royalties from smaller venues
              (pubs and small venues) can take 6-9 months to come through;
              royalties from larger venues (academies, for example) usually take
              9-12 months to come through and royalties from overseas venues and
              festivals can take a year or more to come through. It’s important
              to note that this waiting time begins when We Did It Global
              creates your IPI number from the COMPASS (our COMs) and register
              your songs in the worldwide catalogue.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <span> What’s my IPI number? </span>

            <p>
              IPI number know as Interested Party Information if the unique ID
              as an Author or composer. This number is created for you by the
              Collective Management Organisation and all your music and lyrics
              are registered under the IPI number for easy reference and royalty
              collection.

          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <span> How do I get paid? </span>

            <p>
              You will be paid your share of any performance royalties worldwide
              except Sri Lanka directly by the COMPASS, your CMO. Any other
              earning from mechanical royalties We Did It Global makes
              distributions quarterly in January, April, July and October. You
              will receive an email statement from us if the balance of your
              account totals over LKR 1000. We will pay out any amount above RS
              1000 directly to the payment information you have provided us in
              your name.

              Why don’t you automatically collect my Neighbouring Rights
              royalties?
            </span>
            <p>
              Neighbouring Rights refer to the royalties owed for the broadcast
              of the master recordings. As a publisher we do not traditionally
              represent the master recordings of our artists. This usually falls
              under the role of the label; however, it is becoming more common
              for artists to retain their master rights and We Did It Global has
              a separate label when this is the case, we can represent the
              master rights holder share and collect their Neighbouring Rights
              royalties on our clients’ behalf. Apparently my song got played on
              a TV show, was this through We Did It Global? The way TV should
              works in the Sri Lanka is under blanket license deals, so any
              producer can use any track at any-time as long as the tracks are
              registered with the CMO in Sri Lanka which is yet to establish or
              to proactively licence use of songs on their original publication.

          <div class="card">
            <span> Can I claim royalties for a cover song I have created?</span>
            <p>
              We are unable to collect royalties for cover songs. As a
              publisher, we collect for any original compositions on behalf of
              the original songwriters.
